# Sudoku Solver
A sudoku solver that deploys a backtracking algorithm to find the correct solution to a game. By entering a string of numbers that represents a valid sudoku board, the program will then compute a solution while displaying the live number of calculations made.

Extensions will be made by using the Pygame module to create an interactive UI that displays a live-feed of the backtracking algorithm's computations.
